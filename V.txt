Migration 
is when a virtual machine (VM) moves from one computer to another or changes where its data is stored, all while it is still working.

Monitor
A monitor is a tool that keeps an eye on how well virtual machines and other parts of a computer system are working and using resources.

1. vSphere: 
VMware vSphere is a system that helps run and manage virtual computers in the cloud.

2. vMotion: 
VMware vMotion lets you move running virtual computers between physical servers without any downtime, keeping everything running smoothly.

3. Resource Pools: 
Resource pools are groups of computer resources (like CPU and memory) that can be shared with virtual computers based on their needs, making resource management easier.

4. Virtual Machines (VMs): 
Virtual machines are like software versions of real computers that can run programs and operating systems. They operate in a virtual environment like VMware vSphere.

5. ESXi host: 
ESXi is software that allows a physical server to run virtual machines. 
An ESXi host is simply a physical server that uses this software.

6. vCenter Server Appliance: 
vCenter Server Appliance is a ready-made software tool that helps manage multiple ESXi hosts and their virtual machines from one place.

7. vSphere Update Manager: 
This tool helps keep computer systems updated by fixing software and security issues for servers and virtual machines.  

8. vSphere DRS: 
This feature spreads computer works evenly among servers, so everything runs smoothly, moving virtual machines around as needed.  

9. Standard Switch: 
This is a virtual switch that connects virtual machines to the internet and to each other on the same server.  

10. Port Group: 
This is a way to organize different connections on a switch, allowing you to set rules for how virtual machines connect to networks.  

11. VMFS: (Virtual Machine File System)
This is a special system for managing storage that helps virtual machines work efficiently and safely save data.  

12. iSCSI: (Internet Small Computer Systems Interface)
This is a method to send storage commands over the internet, allowing virtual machines to use storage devices connected through the network.

13. NFS: (Network File System)
NFS is a way to access files from another computer over a network. 
In VMware vSphere, it helps store and access information for virtual machines (VMs) on special storage devices.

14. Cluster: 
A cluster in VMware vSphere is a group of servers that work together as one. 
This setup allows for features that help move virtual machines around and keep them running smoothly.


15. Template:
 A template in VMware vSphere is like a master copy of a virtual machine that you can use to quickly make many identical VMs. 
This saves time and makes sure they are all set up the same way.

16. Active Directory: 
Active Directory is a system made by Microsoft for managing users and computers in a network. 
It keeps track of who can access what and stores information about different resources.
